With long reads this can this can reduce the time taken to complete a sequencing experiment. Alternatively it could be used to exclude specific molecules from a sequencer.\n\n\nTo understand it's implementation, here is a figure showing the standard ONT sequencing workflow. Blue lines indicate the flow of event or base data through the pipeline.\n\n\n\n\nEvent data flows from the minION device under the control of the minKNOW software. These data are output as individual reads to a folder on the disk (Default - C:\\data\\reads). This folder is monitored by metrichor and the reads uploaded and base called. Metrichor moves non base called reads to a folder called \"uploads\" once they have been uploaded and writes the base called files to a folder called \"downloads\".\n\n\nWhen running read until, an additional windows executable is run - ws_event_sampler. Event data are streamed from minKNOW via the ws_event_sampler program and made available to realtime processing scripts via the Read Until API. Event/Read data are again illustrated with blue arrows. Read rejection messages are passed via the Read Until API to ws_event_sampler and from there to minKNOW and the minION device itself to reject a read from a specific channel.",

The program streaming the data is called ws_event_sampler.exe and this is found in the folder\n\n\nC:\\grouper\\binaries\\bin\n\n\n\nwhich is available after installing minKNOW.\n\n\nFirst navigate to this folder:\n\n\ncd \\grouper\\binaries\n\n\n\nws_event_sampler can run either stand alone in simulation mode, or alongside minKNOW as it is running. For simulations, we suggest you start minKNOW and have it open (but not actually sequencing). Then start ws_event_sampler in simulation mode. In this way you will see the output from our scripts in the minKNOW messages window.\n\n\nRunning ws_event_sampler is done as follows:\n\n\nbin\\ws_event_sampler.exe\n\n\n\n*** NOTE: The command itself is bin\\ws_event_sampler.exe so the command is executed from the folder binaries, not from within the folder bin. Executing the file from within the bin folder will result in the program crashing with a message about being unable to open a config file.\n\n\n*** NOTE: ws_event_sampler provides no visible indication that it is running other than blocking the command line. If it fails, it will terminate - sometimes with an error message, but often not. Support for ws_event_sampler is available direct from ONT. We hope we have provided sufficient guidance for its use in the context of our scripts here.\n\n\nws_event_sampler can be run in simulation mode to facilitate the development of analysis scripts. When running in simulation mode, ws_event_sampler provides reads driven from a model file stored locally. This same model file must be used to analyse data when in simulation mode.

            "text": "Read until works by streaming data from minKNOW during a run to an external analysis pipeline and receiving instructions to reject reads as required. The program streaming the data is called ws_event_sampler.exe and this is found in the folder  C:\\grouper\\binaries\\bin  which is available after installing minKNOW.  First navigate to this folder:  cd \\grouper\\binaries  ws_event_sampler can run either stand alone in simulation mode, or alongside minKNOW as it is running. For simulations, we suggest you start minKNOW and have it open (but not actually sequencing). Then start ws_event_sampler in simulation mode. In this way you will see the output from our scripts in the minKNOW messages window.  Running ws_event_sampler is done as follows:  bin\\ws_event_sampler.exe  *** NOTE: The command itself is bin\\ws_event_sampler.exe so the command is executed from the folder binaries, not from within the folder bin. Executing the file from within the bin folder will result in the program crashing with a message about being unable to open a config file.  *** NOTE: ws_event_sampler provides no visible indication that it is running other than blocking the command line. If it fails, it will terminate - sometimes with an error message, but often not. Support for ws_event_sampler is available direct from ONT. We hope we have provided sufficient guidance for its use in the context of our scripts here.  ws_event_sampler can be run in simulation mode to facilitate the development of analysis scripts. When running in simulation mode, ws_event_sampler provides reads driven from a model file stored locally. This same model file must be used to analyse data when in simulation mode.

Read Discarded. Unlikely to generate good 2D.\n1...11: Amplicon numbers followed by current coverage counts satisfying highest stringency tests.\nBF: Bad Files - these files contain more events than the -length threshold.

Files which are already basecalled will be written to a subfolder called \"Downloads\". Raw files will just be written to the specified output directory.\n\n\nNote that the example read set here has been preselected to contain 10 reads mapping to each amplicon and all the reads are 2D - thus the HF value is 110 and the DO value is 0.\n\n\nIt is also important to note that this script uses the hairpin_found flag in the read files. Since minKNOW version 0.51.1.51 (released February 22nd 2016) the writing of this flag to read files has been problematic. Thus reads generated with this version of minKNOW may appear to have far fewer 2D reads than they really do.\n\n\nampliconSPLIT.py\n\n\nampliconSPLIT.py simulates read until on either raw or basecalled reads. It ignores the first 50 events of a read and matches the subsequent 250 events against a reference squiggle. Read until only ever processes template data and so only a template model is required.\n\n\nThe ampliconSPLIT workflow is illustrated below. Note that unlike ampbalance, ampliconSPLIT will separate read files into a directory per amplicon.\n\n\n\n\nThis script will process reads into subfolders in the targetpath corresponding to each amplicon described in the -ids file - e.g /targetpath/{amplicon_number}. If the read is basecalled, it will be placed in a downloads subfolder - e.g /targetpath/{amplicon_number}/downloads .\n\n\nFirst navigate to the RUscripts folder in a windows command terminal:\n\n\ncd \\path\\to\\RUscripts\n\n\n\nTo print the ampliconSPLIT.py help statement at the prompt ($) type:\n\n\npython ampliconSPLIT.py -h\n\n\n\nwhich will output:\n\n\nusage: ampliconSPLIT.py [-h] -fasta FASTA -ids IDS -w WATCHDIR -o TARGETPATH\n                    -d DEPTH -procs PROCS -t TEMP_MODEL [-v] [-ver]\n\nampliconSPLIT: A program designed to identify and group individual amplicons\nfrom minION reads prior to base calling.

            "text": "Ampbalance is a script which will map entire 2D reads to a reference sequence, identify those likely to give a good 2D read by determining if the template and complement reads overlap with one another appropriately and subsequently copy a defined number of those reads up to a specific depth into a folder for further analysis. This script was originally written to facilitate the sequencing and analysis of Ebola virus and to simplify the transfer of read data prior to base calling where network bandwidth was limited (see Quick, J., Loman, N. J., Duraffour, S., Simpson, J. T.   Severi, E. Real-time, portable genome sequencing for Ebola Surveillance. Nature, doi:10.1038/nature16996 (2016).)  Unlike read until applications this script uses the entire read and so requires both the template and complement models.  The image below illustrates how it works.

It is also important to note that this script uses the hairpin_found flag in the read files. Since minKNOW version 0.51.1.51 (released February 22nd 2016) the writing of this flag to read files has been problematic.

You are strongly advised to run simulations of read until prior to running on a live flow cell. The code as presented here is a demonstration of read until and one implementation. Users run this code entirely at their own risk.\n\n\nBelow is an image illustrating the work flow of gReadUntil on a live run. Note that the data flow is now from the live running minKNOW to ws_event_sampler:\n\n\n\n\nTo run on live data, first change the configuration of ws_event_sampler:\n\n\n(make sure you are in the correct folder):\n\n\ncd \\grouper\\binaries\n\n\n\nThen:\n\n\nbin\\ws_event_sampler.exe -p 9200\n\n\n\nThis will now stream live data from whatever is being sequenced in minKNOW on port 9200\n\n\nTo run gReadUntil you MUST switch the model file to one appropriate for your chemistry and pore type. \nIf you use the wrong model file you will get incorrect matching. We suggest re running the getmodels.py script on a base called read from your most recent run to check the model has not changed.\n\n\nIn a seperate command window navigate to:\n\n\ncd \\path\\to\\RUscripts\\ReadUntil\\\n\n\n\nThe run:\n\n\npython gReadUntil.py -f ..\\J02459.fasta -targets J02459:10000-20000 J02459:30000-45000 -procs 8 -t 100 -m ..\\template_r7.3_e6_70bps_6mer_6.model -ip localhost -p 9200 -length 1000\n\n\n\nNote: gReadUntil.py will write a message to the minKNOW messages window to tell you that we are remotely interacting with it.\n\n\nNote: You should set the -length parameter to the expected average length of your library.\n\n\nNote: As long as the appropriate ports are not blocked by your firewalls there is no reason why this code cannot be run on a separate computer - just configure the -ip statement accordingly.\n\n\nNote: ws_event_sampler doesn't write out a log file when running on real data. gReadUntil can optionally output a log file in these cases with the -log option (e.g -log greaduntil.log). This will output the following information:\n\n\nMessage:Channel,Read Number,Decision,Read Start Time,Ref ID,Distance,Orientation,Mapping Site\nINFO:24,2,REJ,23180.0,J02459,40.2154438853,F,3946\nINFO:25,2,REJ,23180.0,J02459,55.6327533467,F,6118\nINFO:26,2,SEQ,23180.0,J02459,76.1823545251,F,30637\nINFO:27,2,SEQ,23180.0,J02459,59.4201521716,F,34466\nINFO:28,2,REJ,23180.0,J02459,54.9151805152,F,47491\nINFO:20,2,SEQ,23180.0,J02459,52.824718186,F,30341\nINFO:29,2,REJ,23180.0,J02459,79.6781198595,F,20583\nINFO:21,2,REJ,23180.0,J02459,38.8591792471,F,7760\nINFO:23,2,REJ,23180.0,J02459,88.8619009677,F,20119\nINFO:22,2,REJ,23180.0,J02459,42.0277615893,F,5046\nINFO:4,2,REJ,23180.0,J02459,70.3307290757,F,26892\nINFO:8,2,REJ,23180.0,J02459,53.4937773307,F,5241\nINFO:59,2,SEQ,23180.0,J02459,54.0416642491,F,16105\nINFO:58,2,SEQ,23180.0,J02459,41.8579884151,F,12718\nINFO:55,2,SEQ,23180.0,J02459,40.0786231863,F,44787\nINFO:54,2,REJ,23180.0,J02459,57.7941719418,F,4125\nINFO:57,2,SEQ,23180.0,J02459,38.6372122551,F,10265\n\n\n\nAmplicon Balancing and Selective Sequencing\n\n\nThis script enables balanced sequencing of individual amplicons from a pool of amplicons. In its current form the script will try to balance the number of amplicons sequenced and so ensure uniform coverage. Alternatively, the script will enable the selection of individual amplicons, or even different coverage depths for each amplicon.\n\n\nRead Tracking\n\n\nThese methods are complicated by how the script tracks the final reads. We currently define three different optional counting points for a read:\n\n\n1) read - We track each channel individually. A read is assumed to have completed if another read is seen at that channel. This method assumes that every read start reported by read until will result in a true final sequenced read. By observation, we know that this assumption can fail. Presumably unseen minKNOW errors contribute to some of these failures. It is also possible that an observed read is not a true sequence or failed to generate sufficient data.\n\n\n2) file - Here we track files as they are written to disk. Files written to disk are paired up with entries tracked via read until and so matching data are conserved. When running a 2D library prep, a common failure are 1D reads - i.e a complement sequence is not detected. Thus it is possible that when counting files, 1D only reads might lower the yield.\n\n\n3) 2d - Here we track files in the same way, but further we inspect for the 2d flag within a file. This allows us to count the number of 2d potential reads (all prior to base calling). It should be noted that the current version of minKNOW at the time of writing - 0.51.1.62 - has some problems with event and hairpin detection, resulting in lower than expected 2d read counts.\n\n\nminKNOW Interaction\n\n\nBecause aReadUntil implements read tracking it needs to be able to 'see' reads as they are written to disk. This script also provides an implementation of the 'Run Until' concept - so it can optionally stop your sequencer when it believes a task is complete. It therefore communicates with minKNOW and sends messages to the Messages window on minKNOW. Because of this it expects minKNOW to be running and if the software cannot communicate with minKNOW it will stop with an error message. It makes this requirement even when running from the simulator.\n\n\nRunning with metrichor/basecallers\n\n\naReadUntil interacts with read files. Metrichor moves files as they are basecalled from the folder they are in to a second folder. To avoid conflict, we have made aReadUntil move files as well. You should therefore point metrichor at this folder, not the usual output folder. The order of events is:\n\n\n1) minKnow writes file to folder (typically C:\\data\\reads)\n2) aReadUntil observes read, processes it and moves it to a 'done' folder ( C:\\data\\reads\\done)\n3) metrichor reads files from the done folder and moves them to 'uploaded' and 'downloaded' as appropriate (C:\\data\\reads\\done\\uploaded and C:\\data\\reads\\done\\downloads)\n\n\n\nFirst navigate to the correct folder:\n\n\ncd \\path\\to\\RUscripts\\ReadUntil\\\n\n\n\nTo see the help message from aReadUntil type:\n\n\npython aReadUntil.py -h\n\n\n\nwhich will output:\n\n\nusage: aReadUntil.py [-h] -fasta FASTA [-c] -ids IDS [-d DEPTH]\n                     [-cd CUSTOMDEPTH] -e DEPTHERROR -procs PROCS -t TIME -m\n                     TEMP_MODEL -g GOAL [-precision] [-seq SPEED] [-i] [-s]\n                     [-ip IP] -p PORT [-wt WRITETIME] -w WATCHDIR\n                     [-log LOGFILE] [-v] [-v2] [-sim] [-ver]\n\naReadUntil: A program providing read until with the Oxford Nanopore minION\ndevice.

This folder\n                        must already exist. The script will not create it for\n                        you.

This allows the user to monitor what is happening on a sequencer via the read until api without ever actually rejecting reads. All other elements of the code (including squiggle matching) function. This allows for testing of the code without affecting sequencing.\n\n\n-s \n This option enables 'Run Until' - so the script will switch off your sequencer when it determines the goal has been reached.\n\n\n-wt \n Used in conjunction with 'Run Until' this option will allow the sequencer to continue running for a period of time after the goal has been reached. If using file or 2d tracking the default value of 15 seconds is sufficient. For read tracking it may be desirable to set this value to 180 or greater. This parameter can be tuned according to the rate at which minKNOW writes reads to disk.\n\n\n-seq \n The various chemistries used for nanopore sequencing operate at different speeds. This script tracks the number of reads currently being sequenced. To ensure that we don't end up with a read which never finishes being counted as 'currently sequenced' we calculate the anticipated length of the amplicons and with knowledge of the sequencing speed allow reads to 'time-out' if they have been considered active for too long. For the simulator, the default value of 30 b/s is correct, but this should be specified for the chemistry in use.  \n\n\n-c  \n This option will remove sequence from the center and 3'end of each strand of each amplicon from the reference sequence being matched too. This reduces the search space and so speeds up the rate of squiggle matching.\n\n\n-precision \n This option will attempt to limit the over sequencing of reads. It often adds time to a sequencing run rather than reducing it. This is a consequence of the observation that not all reads that begin to be sequenced will end up being written to disk for a variety of failure reasons. We do not suggest using this option at this time.\n\n\n-sim  \n This option will write out artificial fast5 files derived from the read until data stream to fully enable testing of the scripts. Reads are automatically written to the specified watchdir (set with the -w flag)\n\n\naReadUntil.py - Amplicon Selection Simulation\n\n\nFirst we illustrate the workflow of amplicon balancing on simulated data. Note that we now use our script to write simulated read to a test folder to enable testing of read counting (see below). As before blue lines indicate the flow of event/read data, red lines the rejection control messages and dashed black lines the flow of control information to minKNOW.\n\n\n\n\nTo simulate amplicon sequencing we provide a workaround to enable the ws_event_sampler to stream individual amplicons. This requires a specially engineered fasta file, lambda_amplicons.fasta. This file contains amplicons in both forward and reverse complement orientation. Of the 11 amplicons, all odd numbered amplicons are present at 1x (1,3,5,7,9,11). Even numbered amplicons are present at different concentrations to simulate an uneven library.\n\n\nIn an separate administrator window navigate to:\n\n\ncd \\grouper\\binaries\n\n\n\nTo run ws_event_sampler with this file in a cmd window with administrator privileges enter:\n\n\nbin\\ws_event_sampler.exe -p 9200 -s --sim-channels 512 --sim-fragment-length 1 1 1900 --sim-fasta C:\\path\\to\\ReadUntil\\lambda_amplicons.fasta --sim-log amplicon-sim.log\n\n\n\nNote: You can vary the number of channels as you feel appropriate for your computer. For the sim fragment length, we specify a length of 1900 bases per read. This forces the fragment to include the entire lenght of each amplicon with some flex around the start site, approximating what you might see on a real run.\n\n\nTo run an appropriate command for aReadUntil.py enter this command in another cmd window:\n\n\npython aReadUntil.py -fasta ..\\J02459.fasta -ids ..\\lambda_amplicons.txt -procs 8 -c -t 40 -m C:\\grouper\\binaries\\conf\\synthesis\\model.txt -g 2d -seq 30 -ip localhost -p 9200 -w test  -s -sim -d 50 -e 0 -i\n\n\n\nThis command will use the lambda reference (-fasta ..\\J02459.fasta) and the amplicon definitions (-ids ..\\lambda_amplicons.txt) and match reads across 8 processors (-procs 8).\n\n\nTo optimise the experiment, we are tuning the reference sequence to omit regions that are unlikely to appear in the reads using the -c flag. This reduces the search time, but will misidentify reads that do not start within the first appoximately 400 bases of a specific amplicon.\n\n\nThe -t flag is set to 20 seconds. If a read has not been processed within 40 seconds of its start time it is automatically rejected. This is to ensure that a long queue of reads does not build up waiting for processing on slow systems. In the event of a timeout, the message:\n\n\nRead timeout\n\n\n\nWill be written to the screen. This is a warning to indicate that the script is not keeping up with the run. It would be advisable to consider upping the number of processors available or reducing the scale of the experiment if possible. One or two Read Timeouts are reasonable and they will reduce as the flow cell decays, but this should be monitored. One way to increase the processing power available is to run this code from a second server. See the notes on this below.\n\n\nFor running with the simulator, the correct model must be used (currently as shown the model.txt file).\n\n\nThis run is looking at 2d reads (-g 2d) and assumes that sequencing is happening at approximately 30 b/s (-seq 30). We assume you are running on the same computer as minKNOW so the -ip is localhost and we have set ws_event_sampler running on port 9200 so -p 9200. The script is monitoring a folder called  \"test\" for the reads. As this is a simulation, the -sim flag is set and the script will write reads itself to the test folder.\n\n\nThe aim of this experiment is to sequence each amplicon at a depth of 50x (-d 50). The -e flag here is set to 0 and thus all amplicons must reach 50x. If -e is set to 5, then a value of 45x would be acceptable.\n\n\nFinally for this first test we will not actually send any rejection messages (-i). This allows us to monitor the reads being produced without any interference from read until.\n\n\nThis command will run through various checks on parameters entered and request you confirm that you wish to run read until on your system.\n\n\nminoTour software is monitoring read until and will alert you when you have reached your target of 50x coverage on each amplicon.\n{'J02459': 48502}\nMean amplicon length: 1929\nAutocalculated time threshold(s): 321\n                                `\n          ;`               ,;\n           :;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;,\n              , .;;;;;, ,\n       @@@@@@@@ ;;;;;;; @@@@@@@@\n     @@@@@@@@@@# ;;;;; +@@@@@@@@@@\n    #@@@@@@`@@@@@ .;. @@@@@.@@@@@@@\n    .@@@@@    @@@@@@@@@@@    @@@@@:\n     .@@@@`    @@@@@@@@@     @@@@,\n       '@@@@@@+ @@@@@@@ '@@@@@@+\n          ;@@@#  @@@@@. +@@@; inoTour read until routines.\n               .;;;;;;;,\n              ;;;.   .;;;`\n              ;;       ;;`\nWelcome to the .;;:     ,;;,\n\nThis script will not implement read until.

As before blue lines indicate the flow of event/read data, red lines the rejection control messages and dashed black lines the flow of control information to minKNOW.\n\n\n\n\nIn an separate administrator window navigate to:\n\n\ncd \\grouper\\binaries\n\n\n\nTo run amplicon balancing on live data, first change the configuration of ws_event_sampler:\n\n\nbin\\ws_event_sampler.exe -p 9200\n\n\n\nThis will now stream live data from whatever is being sequenced in minKNOW on port 9200.\n\n\nFor the aReadUntil.py script it is essential that you:\n\n\n\n\nUse the correct model file for your chemistry.\n\n\nSet the correct sequencing speed for your chemistry. (Currently tested on up to 70b/s)\n\n\nPoint aReadUntil at the correct folder for seeing the raw reads as output by minKNOW (typically C:\\data\\reads). aReadUntil.py does not create this folder itself. It must already exist. If aReadUntil cannot see the reads, it cannot keep track of reads actually written to disk.\n\n\naReadUntil will move reads it has seen to a subfolder called 'done' within the reads folder (so typically C:\\data\\reads\\done) and it is this folder that you should point metrichor too.\n\n\n\n\nYou can then run any of the script options to try aReadUntil. Below are some suggested usage examples:\n\n\nTo monitor a run without implementing read until, alerting when you have 40x coverage of each amplicon:\n\n\npython aReadUntil.py -fasta ..\\J02459.fasta -ids ..\\lambda_amplicons.txt -procs 8 -c -t 40 -m ..\\template_r7.3_e6_70bps_6mer_6.model -g 2d -seq 70 -ip localhost -p 9200 -w test  -s -d 40 -e 0 -i\n\n\n\nTo implement read until, stopping the run when you have 40x coverage of each amplicon:\n\n\npython aReadUntil.py -fasta ..\\J02459.fasta -ids ..\\lambda_amplicons.txt -procs 8 -c -t 40 -m ..\\template_r7.3_e6_70bps_6mer_6.model -g 2d -seq 70 -ip localhost -p 9200 -w test  -s -d 40 -e 0\n\n\n\nTo completely prevent the sequencing of a subset of amplicons (assuming 11 amplicons in total):\n\n\npython aReadUntil.py -fasta ..\\J02459.fasta -ids ..\\lambda_amplicons.txt -procs 8 -c -t 40 -m ..\\template_r7.3_e6_70bps_6mer_6.model -g 2d -seq 70 -ip localhost -p 9200 -w test  -s -cd 10000,0,10000,0,10000,0,10000,0,10000,0,10000 -e 0",

We currently define three different optional counting points for a read:  1) read - We track each channel individually. A read is assumed to have completed if another read is seen at that channel. This method assumes that every read start reported by read until will result in a true final sequenced read. By observation, we know that this assumption can fail. Presumably unseen minKNOW errors contribute to some of these failures. It is also possible that an observed read is not a true sequence or failed to generate sufficient data.  2) file - Here we track files as they are written to disk. Files written to disk are paired up with entries tracked via read until and so matching data are conserved. When running a 2D library prep, a common failure are 1D reads - i.e a complement sequence is not detected. Thus it is possible that when counting files, 1D only reads might lower the yield.  3) 2d - Here we track files in the same way, but further we inspect for the 2d flag within a file. This allows us to count the number of 2d potential reads (all prior to base calling).

This allows the user to monitor what is happening on a sequencer via the read until api without ever actually rejecting reads. All other elements of the code (including squiggle matching) function. This allows for testing of the code without affecting sequencing.  -s   This option enables 'Run Until' - so the script will switch off your sequencer when it determines the goal has been reached.  -wt   Used in conjunction with 'Run Until' this option will allow the sequencer to continue running for a period of time after the goal has been reached. If using file or 2d tracking the default value of 15 seconds is sufficient. For read tracking it may be desirable to set this value to 180 or greater. This parameter can be tuned according to the rate at which minKNOW writes reads to disk.  -seq   The various chemistries used for nanopore sequencing operate at different speeds. This script tracks the number of reads currently being sequenced. To ensure that we don't end up with a read which never finishes being counted as 'currently sequenced' we calculate the anticipated length of the amplicons and with knowledge of the sequencing speed allow reads to 'time-out' if they have been considered active for too long. For the simulator, the default value of 30 b/s is correct, but this should be specified for the chemistry in use.    -c    This option will remove sequence from the center and 3'end of each strand of each amplicon from the reference sequence being matched too. This reduces the search space and so speeds up the rate of squiggle matching.  -precision   This option will attempt to limit the over sequencing of reads. It often adds time to a sequencing run rather than reducing it. This is a consequence of the observation that not all reads that begin to be sequenced will end up being written to disk for a variety of failure reasons. We do not suggest using this option at this time.  -sim    This option will write out artificial fast5 files derived from the read until data stream to fully enable testing of the scripts. Reads are automatically written to the specified watchdir (set with the -w flag)",

            "text": "First we illustrate the workflow of amplicon balancing on simulated data. Note that we now use our script to write simulated read to a test folder to enable testing of read counting (see below). As before blue lines indicate the flow of event/read data, red lines the rejection control messages and dashed black lines the flow of control information to minKNOW.   To simulate amplicon sequencing we provide a workaround to enable the ws_event_sampler to stream individual amplicons. This requires a specially engineered fasta file, lambda_amplicons.fasta. This file contains amplicons in both forward and reverse complement orientation. Of the 11 amplicons, all odd numbered amplicons are present at 1x (1,3,5,7,9,11). Even numbered amplicons are present at different concentrations to simulate an uneven library.  In an separate administrator window navigate to:  cd \\grouper\\binaries  To run ws_event_sampler with this file in a cmd window with administrator privileges enter:  bin\\ws_event_sampler.exe -p 9200 -s --sim-channels 512 --sim-fragment-length 1 1 1900 --sim-fasta C:\\path\\to\\ReadUntil\\lambda_amplicons.fasta --sim-log amplicon-sim.log  Note: You can vary the number of channels as you feel appropriate for your computer. For the sim fragment length, we specify a length of 1900 bases per read. This forces the fragment to include the entire lenght of each amplicon with some flex around the start site, approximating what you might see on a real run.  To run an appropriate command for aReadUntil.py enter this command in another cmd window:  python aReadUntil.py -fasta ..\\J02459.fasta -ids ..\\lambda_amplicons.txt -procs 8 -c -t 40 -m C:\\grouper\\binaries\\conf\\synthesis\\model.txt -g 2d -seq 30 -ip localhost -p 9200 -w test  -s -sim -d 50 -e 0 -i  This command will use the lambda reference (-fasta ..\\J02459.fasta) and the amplicon definitions (-ids ..\\lambda_amplicons.txt) and match reads across 8 processors (-procs 8).  To optimise the experiment, we are tuning the reference sequence to omit regions that are unlikely to appear in the reads using the -c flag. This reduces the search time, but will misidentify reads that do not start within the first appoximately 400 bases of a specific amplicon.  The -t flag is set to 20 seconds. If a read has not been processed within 40 seconds of its start time it is automatically rejected. This is to ensure that a long queue of reads does not build up waiting for processing on slow systems. In the event of a timeout, the message:  Read timeout  Will be written to the screen. This is a warning to indicate that the script is not keeping up with the run. It would be advisable to consider upping the number of processors available or reducing the scale of the experiment if possible. One or two Read Timeouts are reasonable and they will reduce as the flow cell decays, but this should be monitored. One way to increase the processing power available is to run this code from a second server. See the notes on this below.  For running with the simulator, the correct model must be used (currently as shown the model.txt file).  This run is looking at 2d reads (-g 2d) and assumes that sequencing is happening at approximately 30 b/s (-seq 30). We assume you are running on the same computer as minKNOW so the -ip is localhost and we have set ws_event_sampler running on port 9200 so -p 9200. The script is monitoring a folder called  \"test\" for the reads. As this is a simulation, the -sim flag is set and the script will write reads itself to the test folder.  The aim of this experiment is to sequence each amplicon at a depth of 50x (-d 50). The -e flag here is set to 0 and thus all amplicons must reach 50x. If -e is set to 5, then a value of 45x would be acceptable.  Finally for this first test we will not actually send any rejection messages (-i). This allows us to monitor the reads being produced without any interference from read until.  This command will run through various checks on parameters entered and request you confirm that you wish to run read until on your system.  minoTour software is monitoring read until and will alert you when you have reached your target of 50x coverage on each amplicon.\n{'J02459': 48502}\nMean amplicon length: 1929\nAutocalculated time threshold(s): 321\n                                `\n          ;`               ,;\n           :;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;,\n              , .;;;;;, ,\n       @@@@@@@@ ;;;;;;; @@@@@@@@\n     @@@@@@@@@@# ;;;;; +@@@@@@@@@@\n    #@@@@@@`@@@@@ .;. @@@@@.@@@@@@@\n    .@@@@@    @@@@@@@@@@@    @@@@@:\n     .@@@@`    @@@@@@@@@     @@@@,\n       '@@@@@@+ @@@@@@@ '@@@@@@+\n          ;@@@#  @@@@@. +@@@; inoTour read until routines.\n               .;;;;;;;,\n              ;;;.   .;;;`\n              ;;       ;;`\nWelcome to the .;;:     ,;;,\n\nThis script will not implement read until.

Sequencing will be stopped now!  Note that each amplicon has at least 50x coverage.  On these specific examples, the amplicons are already reasonably balanced and so no significant time saving is seen. If we try and induce a different patter, greater speed ups are seen. To illustrate we will use the custom depth option to sequence a 'ladder' pattern, going from 0x coverage on amplicon 1 to 500x coverage on amplicon 11.  To do this, type the following command:  python aReadUntil.py -fasta ..\\J02459.fasta -ids ..\\lambda_amplicons.txt -procs 8 -c -t 40 -m C:\\grouper\\binaries\\conf\\synthesis\\model.txt -g 2d -seq 30 -ip localhost -p 9200 -w test  -s -sim -cd 0,50,100,150,200,250,300,350,400,450,500 -e 0  We have substituted the -d flag for -cd.

            "text": "Important Note:  Running read until will influence the behaviour of your flow cell and change the output of your sequencing experiment. You are strongly advised to run simulations of read until prior to running on a live flow cell. The code as presented here is a demonstration of read until and one implementation. Users run this code entirely at their own risk.  We illustrate the workflow of amplicon balancing on real data. Now the script monitors reads being written to disk by minKNOW and moves those scripts to a second folder for subsequent analysis by Metrichor. As before blue lines indicate the flow of event/read data, red lines the rejection control messages and dashed black lines the flow of control information to minKNOW.   In an separate administrator window navigate to:  cd \\grouper\\binaries  To run amplicon balancing on live data, first change the configuration of ws_event_sampler:  bin\\ws_event_sampler.exe -p 9200  This will now stream live data from whatever is being sequenced in minKNOW on port 9200.  For the aReadUntil.py script it is essential that you:   Use the correct model file for your chemistry.  Set the correct sequencing speed for your chemistry. (Currently tested on up to 70b/s)  Point aReadUntil at the correct folder for seeing the raw reads as output by minKNOW (typically C:\\data\\reads). aReadUntil.py does not create this folder itself. It must already exist. If aReadUntil cannot see the reads, it cannot keep track of reads actually written to disk.  aReadUntil will move reads it has seen to a subfolder called 'done' within the reads folder (so typically C:\\data\\reads\\done) and it is this folder that you should point metrichor too.   You can then run any of the script options to try aReadUntil. Below are some suggested usage examples:  To monitor a run without implementing read until, alerting when you have 40x coverage of each amplicon:  python aReadUntil.py -fasta ..\\J02459.fasta -ids ..\\lambda_amplicons.txt -procs 8 -c -t 40 -m ..\\template_r7.3_e6_70bps_6mer_6.model -g 2d -seq 70 -ip localhost -p 9200 -w test  -s -d 40 -e 0 -i  To implement read until, stopping the run when you have 40x coverage of each amplicon:  python aReadUntil.py -fasta ..\\J02459.fasta -ids ..\\lambda_amplicons.txt -procs 8 -c -t 40 -m ..\\template_r7.3_e6_70bps_6mer_6.model -g 2d -seq 70 -ip localhost -p 9200 -w test  -s -d 40 -e 0  To completely prevent the sequencing of a subset of amplicons (assuming 11 amplicons in total):  python aReadUntil.py -fasta ..\\J02459.fasta -ids ..\\lambda_amplicons.txt -procs 8 -c -t 40 -m ..\\template_r7.3_e6_70bps_6mer_6.model -g 2d -seq 70 -ip localhost -p 9200 -w test  -s -cd 10000,0,10000,0,10000,0,10000,0,10000,0,10000 -e 0",
